This can be achieved by using the `-multidir` flag in the GROMACS `mdrun` command, which runs multiple simulations simultaneously in different folders.

    "In the example above, we used 8 MPI processes (denoted as `np`), with 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process (denoted as `ntomp`), to run 4 simulations in parrallel. To determine a more efficient/cost-effective way to allocate comptuational resources for running MD simulations, it is common to perform a scaling test. This involves timing several short simulations with varying values of `np` or `ntomp`. By plotting the performance, such as ns/day (as demonstrated in the bottom of the log file), against `np` or `ntomp`, we can determine the cutoff point where the performance becomes sublinear."
