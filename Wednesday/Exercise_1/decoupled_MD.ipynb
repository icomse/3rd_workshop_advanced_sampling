    "In the example above, we used 8 MPI processes (denoted as `np`), with 2 OpenMP threads per MPI process (denoted as `ntomp`), to run 4 simulations in parrallel. To determine a more efficient/cost-effective way to allocate comptuational resources for running MD simulations, it is common to perform a scaling test. This involves timing several short simulations with varying values of `np` or `ntomp`. By plotting the performance, such as ns/day (as demonstrated in the bottom of the log file), against `np` or `ntomp`, we can determine the cutoff point where the performance becomes sublinear."

    "The result we see above might not be ideal since the system is very small. But generally for larger systems, what one should see is a linear region where the performance is strictly increasing with the comptuational resources and becomes sublinear after a kink point. Although the scaling test for this system might not show the trend, hopefully you get the idea of how to allocate computational resources in a more cost-effective way!"
