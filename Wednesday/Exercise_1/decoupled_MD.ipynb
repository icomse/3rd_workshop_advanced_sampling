This can be achieved by using the `-multidir` flag in the GROMACS `mdrun` command, which runs multiple simulations simultaneously in different folders. This exercise should be performed in an interactive session on Bridges-2, with 32 cores requested. "

    "As shown above, the performance of the simulations increases with the value of `ntomp`/the number of cores. The scaling was approximately linearly up to the point where 16 cores were utilized. In the case of using 32 cores, the performance displayed a slightly sublinear trend. Thus, given the same simulation length, using 16 cores will take long than using 32 cores but is more cost-effective, meaning that it requires fewer computational resources in total to finish the simulation. Therefore, using 16 cores is the optimal choice among the 4 test cases. (Note that the results may slightly vary between different runs, so you might see a linear trend up to 32 cores. However, if more CPU cores are used (which we are not doing here), the trend should eventually becomes sublinear and a cutoff can be determined.)"
